<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Exceptional<em> Businesswoman or Starving E-commerce “Guru”?</em></strong></p>



<p>Reputable business and thought leaders of all types give out their advice regularly, as paid or free consultants, and for various reasons (financial, personal, etc.) they are sought out for their particular expertise and foresight. They may sell books and give speeches for profit, but it’s likely not their first or primary source of wealth and popularity. On the other hand, marketing and e-commerce gurus are often self-proclaimed experts who grossly overstate their abilities and are obsessively marketing themselves as successful, using luxurious homes and cars materialistically, to push their followers into a particular investment or business scheme.</p>

						<div class="vlp-link-summary">
			How the “Insta-Famous” Entrepreneur, Iyia Liu, exploited New Zealand’s media to sell a botched brand disguised as success and inspiration		</div>
			</div>
</div>



<p>The media has been very keen to show New Zealand what a successful woman looks like through Iyia Liu and her press releases, so how does her business sense really hold up? Ms Liu technically started selling her business growth course and consulting services about two years ago, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12162536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Herald’s continued interest in writing puff pieces for Iyia and her students</a>&nbsp;(despite multiple concerns regarding the accuracy of her entrepreneurial feats) has given me enough motivation to investigate further. I’d hate to rip into Aimee Shaw of the Herald, but her reporting isn’t in the consumer’s best interest (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11913888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defunct Cryptocurrency Scam Sell My Good</a>).</p>



<p>In a strategy that appears eerily close to Sam Ovens or Alex Becker’s infamous sales funnels, Iyia Liu aims to teach her students how to emulate the supposed success of Waist Trainer and Luxe Fitness, using Shopify and Instagram influencer marketing. The course itself seems to be a staple item that is promoted to fans of Ms Liu and members of her networking venture, Girls in Business.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Over the past several years, e-commerce has fuelled numerous “insta-famous” rags to riches stories, creating a lot of hype around the marketing strategies that Iyia used in order to grow her own brands. One search on YouTube reveals a stream of videos by marketers like Alex Becker, Gretta Rose Van Riel, and Dan Lok trying to sell their motivational backstories, along with upselling fans to purchase thousands of dollars worth of online courses and seminars. However,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@KiwiAlexJanssen/celebration-box-nz-iyia-liu-and-the-medias-credibility-crisis-exposed-5a594c40f4f8">as we have extensively seen with Ms Liu</a>, the legitimacy of these backstories and the results of these courses are questionable at best.</p>

<p>Most e-commerce “gurus” do not make most or any of their money by selling physical products. Instead, they sell digital courses that can make a large profit passively. Lessons often contain ramblings about “The Hustle”, which represents the entrepreneurial drive to succeed; presenting textbook business and personal management tips that are often marketed as the secrets to success.</p>



<p>With the ability to easily manipulate Google results and buy positive reviews frivolously, gurus often slip under the radar and sneak themselves into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/sam-ovens/#3878a9814ca3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes list, even with a falsely reported net worth</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong><em>Questions everyone must ask before buying from e-commerce gurus:</em></strong></p>



<ol><li>What is the profit margin (not ambiguous sales figures) of “successful” students?</li><li>Why is someone selling a course and not participating in the market themselves?</li></ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1508/0*1uqy-trUTYq_flO3" alt="Screenshot of Iyia's client, Tribe Skin Care showing a Shopify sales for one month."/><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Total Sales reported by Tribe Skincare. Typical marketing for Shopify courses. (Source: Facebook/IyiaLiuBusiness)</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>The reality is that anyone buying Shopify courses will find themselves in some of the most saturated markets, such as beauty and fitness; These businesses may also make a very marginal profit from their large initial investments once taxes and influencer marketing costs are realised.</p>



<p>Interestingly, financial and product failure is often dismissed as expected teething issues, because somehow the gurus can do no wrong with their advice, at least according to fans. And for every example of a failure that comes out, there is a success story that is readily available for use in order to immediately discredit the critics.</p>



<p>I had a look into Iyia Liu’s “How to Start, Run &amp; Grow Your E-Commerce Business” modules, and while there were some helpful pointers to take home, it’s sorely over-valued for what is presented. The provided lessons sound and read more like a dictionary than a how-to guide and explain only a limited number of ambiguous examples of how to apply what is being taught. In other words, the course isn’t very hands on. Some might find success in using her course as a starting point, but it might come down to other factors such as luck and a decent amount of starting initial capital for trial and error.</p>



<p>So instead of turning $6,000 into $3.5 million that Waist Trainer purportedly achieved,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12162536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iyia’s example students are now investing $16,000</a>&nbsp;or more of their own money towards high-risk startups in an attempt to achieve a turnover of at least $1 million. Not to mention, they have to navigate the unforgiving Chinese supplier market, which has been known to push lower quality products and higher prices onto non-Chinese importers.</p>



<p><strong>Important note:</strong>&nbsp;Keep in mind, Iyia and her business partner only put a few thousand into Celebration Box and expect $2 million in turnover. An initial investment of $16,000 is a lot, and in the case of Tribe Skincare,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/groundbreaking-geelong-skincare-business-on-track-to-make-1-million-a-year/news-story/fa82c5f7c4b1d12d50525d1104966e74" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$40,000 is almost 7 or 8 times more than the $6,000 Iyia reportedly had initially invested in Waist Trainer</a>. Barriers to entry are seemingly higher and there’s very little transparency behind how much these businesses are spending to obtain those sales volumes on marketing, product labelling, supplies, GST, and more. For anyone starting out in this business, be careful and don’t lose your life savings to people that are selling you dreams!</p>



<p>Another point to make is that Iyia openly encourages business owners to remove reviews if they can’t achieve 5-star ratings when they start out and to essentially lie to customers about how popular a brand is through misleading sales figures. I’m sure this advice continues to work amicably with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/most-read-complaints-made-commerce-commission-after-celebration-boxs-sweet-startup-gig-turns-sour-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebration Box</a>&nbsp;(which apparently&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/@KiwiAlexJanssen/comment-reply-from-the-company-in-early-jan-9010701adb69">couldn’t cover all of its costs</a>), as it seems that instead of promoting genuine businesses, she is teaching people how to lie to themselves and their friends.</p>



<p>The problem here is not about paying $395 for an overpriced course; In fact, taking a paper in university can be just as underwhelming. But people have to realise that e-commerce gurus are continually misrepresenting themselves and a prospective entrepreneur’s potential success. They almost always set up their courses and correlating support groups on Facebook so that students will eventually buy more courses and consulting services later on, even if they’re just rehashed compilations of free Shopify tutorials on YouTube. And in the case of Sam Ovens, a student that makes millions in turnover is heavily encouraged to fork over tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to attend one of his elite mastermind courses. If Iyia’s offer to provide help for no extra charge lives up to its promise, it may be valuable for some people to work with her. But with the way her numerous other ventures have performed, it’s uncertain if her advice is worth more than a free search on Google.</p>



<p>On top of the several problems that seem to persist with her businesses and the lack of progress on Iyia’s first home in Coatesville after several months, it appears that even Iyia hasn’t yet found her own keys to success.</p>

<p>Celebration Box already found itself in heaps of controversy (and apparently debt) in 2018, when their rapidly growing startup began to sell poor quality confectionary boxes throughout New Zealand.</p>

			</div>
</div>



<p>The company has now moved on to expand their reach overseas, starting with Australia. On Monday, Celebration Box launched a global Instagram page, along with a new .com website and branding.</p>



<p>With the new year and nearly six months of backlash behind them, the company still seems to be conducting business, or at least their global launch, haphazardly and without any real focus on consumers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*D_a1SxUD5I-htqLBVPmBTQ.png" alt=""/><figcaption>The global site is still largely catered to NZ and absent of front matter (Screenshot)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Their&nbsp;<a href="https://instagram.com/celebrationbox_global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global Instagram page</a>&nbsp;displays a selection of wrapped chocolate and candy gift assortments. Yet, a closer look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://celebrationbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>&nbsp;displays the same exact products that are sold in New Zealand,&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/gVYiEXT.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featuring unwrapped doughnuts and lollies</a>. The only difference is that you can select shipping to Australia and elsewhere throughout the world. Maybe the company will do its due diligence and stop orders on perishable products, but the company’s eagerness to push overnight shipping to Australia seems to suggest otherwise.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3024/0*Iw2uQzzdgKHWQioU" alt=""/><figcaption>Throwback to the 90’s (Source: CelebrationBox.com)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Their&nbsp;<a href="https://celebrationbox.com/collections/shop-all-by-best-selling/products/mens-grooming-gift-set" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumph &amp; Disaster gift box</a>&nbsp;is a step in the right direction and reveals an opportunity to enable more global outreach for NZ businesses through the sale of gift boxes. However, the focus on selling candies and chocolates that can be bought from other confectionary box companies overseas provides limited value.</p>



<p>One hurdle to get over is the cost of shipping. Custom shipping food products require special care compared to clothing where drop shipping can usually be applied for savings. I would argue that opening a new warehouse in Australia is more feasible as the shipping costs can quickly stack up.</p>



<p>Secondly,&nbsp;<mark>Australia just introduced a new low-value GST on products valued at less than AU$1,000.</mark>&nbsp;So all import sales to Australia are now subject to GST. This could be a nightmare to deal with, as various brick-and-mortar shops have had to now pony up and enforce customers to pay GST in order to avoid facing a large tax bill.</p>

Pushing an otherwise controversial article about Iyia Liu into an irrelevant steaming pile of rubbish about Max Key and his long-gone ex, Amelia Finlayson.</p>



<p>As far as the Facebook comments confirm, it has done no favours for the show and raises some serious questions about a possible conflict of interest between NZME “reporters” and TVNZ’s public relations team.</p>

<p>What is the Herald’s obsession to continue promoting the glossy and false image of Iyia Liu?</p>



<p>What makes the Herald so desperate to promote someone that the public has no interest in reading about?</p>



<p>It seems that most readers did not make it beyond the first summary of the article, most commenters remained stuck on the issue of Max Key, largely ignoring the existence of BossBabes itself.</p>

<p>Ricardo Simich had previously founded a (now defunct) PR firm with Whale Oil’s Carrick Graham, and has been writing for the Herald, running its gossip column, “Spy.”</p>



<p>Despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11318419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simich’s dismissiveness about the controversy surrounding his business partner and Dirty Politics</a>, their attempt at running a PR firm together expectedly folded very quickly and quietly.</p>



<p>It is known that Simich has also founded his own PR firm, One Agency, which has been reportedly been responsible for&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/food-wine/3203561/New-bubbly-stopper-keeps-the-fizz" target="_blank">seating celebrities for NZ Fashion Week</a>.</p>

<p>Known as a prominent Auckland socialite, he is tasked with following Auckland’s elite, giving the rest of New Zealand a glimpse into the life of endless photo-ops and champagne.</p>



<p>Simich is frequently named in puff pieces, citing his cunning expertise in public relations, so it is no surprise that he would put his name to such a manipulative and deceptive article.</p>



<p>Recently, NZME’s Spy was invited to cover ED&amp;i Body’s launch part, and as with any event, was given permission to publish the “insta-famous” influencers among other socialites who braved the event just to be featured in BossBabes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/04aobPGLKYuF8-dTz-978x1024.png" alt="Norrie Montgomery the photographer for NZ Herald Spy at Ed&amp;I Body" class="wp-image-261" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/04aobPGLKYuF8-dTz-978x1024.png 978w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/04aobPGLKYuF8-dTz-287x300.png 287w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/04aobPGLKYuF8-dTz-768x804.png 768w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/04aobPGLKYuF8-dTz.png 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /><figcaption>Norrie Montgomery Ed&amp;i body launch photos (Facebook)<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>Events that are photographed by Norrie Montgomery (who contracts for NZ Herald’s Spy), are often supported by sponsorships from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mumm.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G.H. Mumm</a>, Ed&amp;I Body’s launch was no exception.</p>



<p>To say the least, it is in the Herald’s best interest to forego journalism in order to secure photography at social events. No worries if Spy is the dusty unread corner of the Herald, it gets employees in the door of the afterparties.</p>

<p><em>Disclosure: I currently maintain financial positions on some of the companies mentioned. This is not financial advice.</em></p>



<p>It&#8217;s odd to write about global finance to a page dedicated to ill-made confectionary boxes, but here it is!</p>



<p>Yesterday, Deutsche Bank decided to lay-off 20 per cent of its global staff and had utterly decided to offload its equities, leaving worthless debt hanging out to dry. In a move reminiscent of the 2008 GFC, Deutsche has restructured to sell off their toxic equities, about €70 billion, to a series of &#8220;bad banks.&#8221;</p>



<p>For what little coverage New Zealand media tends to give these sort of events, it&#8217;s a big deal for the country. Deutsche&#8217;s $1.5 trillion far-reaching assets (from Frankfurt to Sydney) were exposed, leaving the broader economy very vulnerable to a major collapse. Despite what the US Federal Reserve says, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-banks-us-stress-test-123212526.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DB&#8217;s stress test results should be taken with a grain of salt</a>.</p>



<h3>What Does This Have to Do With Celebration Box?</h3>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t. At least not directly&#8230; It does have to do with dodgy mortgages, spruikers, and the promise of quick riches via Instagram and Alibaba.</p>



<p>To put in bluntly&#8230; <strong>China is in debt. Chinese debt will affect China. Chinese debt will also affect everyone else.</strong></p>



<p>The years leading up to the GFC were prosperous, at least on paper. Home ownership was rising, and there were a growing number of instant millionaires coming out of the woodwork. Everyone from property gurus to business experts were holding conferences to get people to start a new venture in life. Usually, such ventures had a caveat that you had to make the speaker rich first.</p>



<p>In fact, the author of <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad, </em><a href="https://thecollegeinvestor.com/4726/ultimate-hypocrite-robert-kiyosaki-companys-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Kiyosaki was heavily pushing his followers into Real Estate in 2006, while his seminars were partnered with a real estate firm.</a></p>



<p>The problem is that spruikers are often not easy to expose or takedown. Their fans have dedicated a lot of time and their life savings into a dream, and believe that only one person or one company is the key to their happiness and success.</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, take the time to read the following blogs below to understand how spruikers are created, and what happens when they are exposed. Also included is a clip from the documentary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_on_Zero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Betting on Zero</em></a><em>, </em>which exposes the pyramid scheme, Herbalife.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>What is apparent is that financial and media institutions can often be complicit in promoting a blatant scam, because they&#8217;re hoping to find some financial gain as well.</p>



<p>Instagram businesses/Influencer marketing only works in the hype cycle of excessive ownership. The sweet spot between 2014 and 2017 saw the rise in Kylie Jenner&#8217;s branding. While Jenner will continue to succeed as a celebrity, a large majority of business gurus and their followers stand to lose a lot.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0a40c158f60c43f84a80a.png" alt="Iyia Liu promoting influencer/digital marketing services to cash in on BossBabes fame." class="wp-image-283" width="450" height="323" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0a40c158f60c43f84a80a.png 450w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0a40c158f60c43f84a80a-300x215.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption>Iyia Liu promoting her influencer marketing services.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While <a href="https://www.girlsinbusiness.org.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Girls in Business</a> is not necessarily a pyramid scheme, it is a vehicle to convince desperate young women (many with student debts or young children) to take on the risk of losing their life savings to start a business. Furthermore, this organisation pushes followers to purchase ebooks and influencer marketing services that are largely ineffective, even for the BossBabes promoting it. Keep in mind, Girls in Business uses volunteers to run the event, not paid staff.</p>



<h3 id="Why-Deutsche-Bank-Is-Relevant">Why Deutsche Bank Is Relevant</h3>



<p>The reason why Deutsche Bank is in such a bad state is because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/business/deutsche-bank-money-laundering-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its exposure to money laundering often perpetrated by members of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)</a>, Russian criminals, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/donald-trumps-biggest-lender-deutsche-bank-was-just-raided-in-a-money-laundering-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and by other players mimicking them</a>.</p>



<p>Deutsche is also a double-edged sword as it has been a big believer in Alibaba as well. This allows for cash dealings to go through a series of international trusts tied into the Bank of China, all underneath the regulatory radar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3438cb9e6a50f037d8d80.png" alt="Boomerang greenback from Mainland China to the outside financial world." class="wp-image-285" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3438cb9e6a50f037d8d80.png 640w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3438cb9e6a50f037d8d80-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption>The Cycle of Dollars to RMB (Twitter: DeepThroatIPO)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The above explains how imports from China funnels through the banks and various instruments of finance to help mainland China retain laundered cash.</p>



<p>Chinese President Xi has taken steps to curb dissenters in an anti-corruption sweep, but (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35962326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as exposed in the Panama Papers</a>) his own family and supporters conduct in the same business.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/iyia-liu-and-the-medias-credibility-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the above exposé on Celebration Box</a>, there is no smoking gun connection made to the party (<a href="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/sold-bambi-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sale of Bambi Boutique</a> is a big hint that any CPC connection is weak), but it does describe how Chinese citizens have obtained properties through unscrupulous mortgages. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://qz.com/638082/a-growing-corner-of-chinas-booming-home-loan-market-looks-a-lot-like-the-us-subprime-bubble/" target="_blank">Synthetic mortgage frauds that plagued the US economy ten years ago have become commonplace among Chinese citizens</a>.</p>



<p>With the desperation of debt looming for many Chinese nationals and expats, the prominence of business and investment &#8220;cults&#8221;, such as Future Living and Waiwera Heights Country Club, has also accelerated the spread of dubious loans throughout China and overseas. In China, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-risk-mortgages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">committing mortgage fraud is common practice</a>, with no one caring to stop it.</p>



<p>Mortgages similar to the ones mentioned above have since been used globally as a tool for laundering money away from banks and investors. Either for Chinese officials to hold money outside of debt-ridden yuan or by greedy citizens looking for riches.</p>



<p>Very few people actually noticed or understood <a href="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/iyia-liu-and-the-medias-credibility-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the second mortgage documents tied to Ms Liu in Waiwera</a>. But it should be worth more attention over the next several months as the scam continues.</p>

<h3 id="How-Exposed-is-New-Zealand?">How Exposed is New Zealand?</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell. New Zealand is an easy place to launder money through a layer of businesses. The government has kickstarted new efforts to tackle laundering under its <a href="https://www.keepourmoneyclean.govt.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Keep Our Money Clean&#8221; campaign</a>, but it feels like it is too little and too late to be effective.</p>



<p>Despite the foreign housing ban, there&#8217;s still the possibility of a mass Chinese exit from currently owned and new developments, which could affect the market.</p>

<p><strong>Wyoming Registered Celebration Bots Considers Legal Action Against Iyia Liu and her Company over Latest Dram</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>Fake/Meme Facebook Page, Celebration Bots, is&nbsp;<a href="https://wyobiz.wy.gov/business/FilingDetails.aspx?eFNum=140010160057043224188137144076049228039072191042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a registered member-managed limited liability company in Wyoming</a>&nbsp;and it has announced its consideration to take legal action over a recently failed attempt to unmask their identities. The act was done by a mysterious investigator that is alleged to have ties to the controversial Celebration Box entrepreneur, Iyia Liu. Members are currently working with the New Zealand Police and an Auckland law firm in order to finalise an official complaint on behalf of their administrators and moderators, who act as shareholders.</p>



<p>Unlike New Zealand, shareholders and directors for Wyoming corporations are not public. Additionally, designated directors called registered agents are paid to maintain companies for clients, making it impossible to know the company’s true owners, even in the event of a lawsuit.</p>



<p>The team that operates the page and research on behalf of Celebration Bots rely on their corporate registration to remain anonymous to the media, especially within the legal and financial system. They also benefit from a previously undisclosed litigation fund allocated to member shareholders, which was created shortly after their corporate formation in December 2018.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0hY9fBOVbpV5xiFHX.png" alt="Screenshots of conversations with Iyia's mystery investigator." class="wp-image-236" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0hY9fBOVbpV5xiFHX.png 744w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0hY9fBOVbpV5xiFHX-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /><figcaption>Initial contact with the mystery investigator.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>According to the page’s spokesperson, a private investigator claiming to represent the entrepreneur acted as a dodgy importer/exporter and baited a moderator to pay for a video containing “sensitive business practices and illegal behavior.” As proof, the investigator under the name, “Mark Jones” (or mjbitcoins/markjonesbitcoin), posted a photo of a nearly 3-minute long video containing Liu’s customised Louis Vuitton bag that dons the letters “I.L”. Jones also told the moderator to guess what was in the bag, to which the moderator guessed “cocaine” and Jones replied “no comment”.</p>



<p>The page moderator then continued to converse with “Mark Jones” through the secure messaging app,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wickr.com/" target="_blank">Wickr</a>&nbsp;to converse privately and exchange money for the damaging video.</p>



<p>After the financial exchange, Jones asked to meet, stating their location in Westgate and pushing for the moderator to give up their address to where they can send a USB of the video. The moderator refused, asking Jones to send the video online.</p>



<p>The next day, a new Wickr account appeared, sending a series of texts to the member stating, “prepare to be exposed”. Sometime later, Mark Jones then revealed themselves as an investigator, citing the need “to know who she is close too [sic] and who she cannot trust” and that the moderator’s name was known to them. The investigator later went on to state that they needed a subpoena (they actually meant court order) for an undisclosed company to reveal the mods name, and would be able to do so by Friday.</p>



<p>In exchange for continued anonymity, the investigator requested a screenshot of the “envious females” involved in talking about Iyia through the page. The investigator then offered for the moderator to meet with “us and Iyia” to sort things out.</p>



<p>The page’s spokesperson admitted that they had paid the investigator $500 worth of bitcoin to purchase information meant to expose unlawful business practices and behaviours by Ms Liu. Expressing the need for “inspirational public figures to not act or do business illegally.” The spokesperson also stated that any details about moderators the investigator claimed to have was non-existent, just like the fictitious video that they sold.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0dqdMvAkPQaRNgPZH-768x1024.jpeg" alt="Video still of Iyia Liu's Louis Vuitton Bag." class="wp-image-237" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0dqdMvAkPQaRNgPZH-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0dqdMvAkPQaRNgPZH-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0dqdMvAkPQaRNgPZH.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>Video Still of Iyia Liu’s Louis Vuitton Bag (Supplied)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Celebration Bots members have also expressed doubt that the person they interacted with was truly an Investigator, citing the lack of common operational practices/procedures that were witnessed. This suspicion remained due to the investigator revealing themselves online in such a short timespan rather than in person.</p>



<p>After the investigator was refused information on the admins of the celebration bots page, the member was called several times through Wickr and sent a number of messages from additional accounts, with one named “maxkeyg”.</p>



<p>Celebration Bots declined to comment on how many shareholders they have, citing privacy reasons.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time the page has threatened legal action before. The page was responsible for sending a series of cease &amp; desist letters to Iyia Liu after Liu accused them of several acts, including sending false information to the media and creating fake accounts to frame her for bullying.</p>



<p>The page’s legal representative stressed the importance of understanding how this mystery investigator connects to Ms Liu and her employees. Claiming that this latest investigator drama was “just the latest attempt to stress, flush out, and shame Iyia’s close and personal detractors. They weren’t interested in exposing anyone they don’t know or work with.”</p>



<p>Shareholders of Celebration Bots will vote on the decision to pursue legal action this Thursday.</p>



<p>Ms Liu recently came under fire this Sunday after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/spy/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503840&amp;objectid=12222068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Zealand Herald revealed</a>&nbsp;(seemingly prematurely) her feature in the OnDemand show&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/shows/bossbabes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BossBabes</a>. It is unclear if this latest debacle is a part of the series, but Celebration Bots deny any ties to TVNZ and strongly condemn the network for using Iyia Liu in their OnDemand series. Bots members believe that this investigator troll attack was likely retaliation for helping to reveal the show too early.</p>

<p><em>Critics Also Speculate That Bambi Boutique is Sold and The End is Near for Celebration Box and The Owner is Moving On</em></p>



<p>Last November, the New Zealand Herald was nearly ready to call Iyia Liu “NZ’s own Kylie Jenner”; Comparing Ms Liu’s once perceived wealth and business success to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2019/03/05/at-21-kylie-jenner-becomes-the-youngest-self-made-billionaire-ever/#583c2ed62794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s youngest self-made billionaire</a>. However, it seems that the Instafamous entrepreneur has had to hang up the towel on her year-old clothing startup, Bambi Boutique, as she has now&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/MfytRHx.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed any reference of ever founding the company in her Instagram bio</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_wGAfWpk3-3ds_wCo4-Dx2w-e1587184470376-1024x965.png" alt="" class="wp-image-141" width="768" height="724" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_wGAfWpk3-3ds_wCo4-Dx2w-e1587184470376-1024x965.png 1024w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_wGAfWpk3-3ds_wCo4-Dx2w-e1587184470376-300x283.png 300w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_wGAfWpk3-3ds_wCo4-Dx2w-e1587184470376-768x724.png 768w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_wGAfWpk3-3ds_wCo4-Dx2w-e1587184470376.png 1395w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>In what looks to be the latest misstep for Ms Liu and Marketing Manager, Sophie Maitland, Bambi Boutique was allegedly sold this month;&nbsp;<mark>“Priced to sell at $60,000 plus estimated stock value $60k”, according to an&nbsp;</mark><mark><a href="https://www.businessesforsale.co.nz/business/home-based-it-online/auckland/home-based-online-fashion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ad posted by the business brokerage firm, ABC Business Sales</a></mark><mark>&nbsp;(screenshot of removed ad attached as a response comment below).</mark>&nbsp;Any difference in the final sales price may remain undisclosed due to confidentiality agreements arranged by the company’s listing agent.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_OaGQplcadSZSW4JPPicgSQ-577x1024.png" alt="Bambi Boutique labelled yacht" class="wp-image-143" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_OaGQplcadSZSW4JPPicgSQ-577x1024.png 577w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_OaGQplcadSZSW4JPPicgSQ-169x300.png 169w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_OaGQplcadSZSW4JPPicgSQ-768x1364.png 768w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_OaGQplcadSZSW4JPPicgSQ-865x1536.png 865w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_OaGQplcadSZSW4JPPicgSQ.png 1014w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /></figure></div>



<p>Despite starting in the saturated market of budget e-commerce clothing, Bambi Boutique came into recognition in late 2017 for reportedly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5147147/Iyia-Liu-new-business-blows-overnight-one-simple-idea.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaining 70,000 followers overnight</a>. The company made further headlines in early 2018 for hosting influencer studded launch parties, including an event hosted on the&nbsp;<a href="https://moondance.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moondance Charter Yacht</a>, which donned the Bambi Boutique logo.</p>



<p>According to various blogs, Iyia&nbsp;<a href="https://theregister.co.nz/news/2018/02/bambi-boutique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid as little as $2,000 to host company launch parties</a>, while relying on vendors to subsidise the events in exchange for the opportunity to directly target the brand’s audience.</p>



<p>After Ms Liu’s latest company, Celebration Box, became the subject of severe controversy, scepticism began to circulate around the authenticity of Bambi Boutique’s nearly 300,000 followers on Instagram and Facebook. Critics of Ms Liu specifically noted&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*XqTjh7APEKsHPDnTGlxRZA.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden spikes of followers</a>&nbsp;and low engagement activity on the company’s social media pages, citing the suspicious trends as evidence of a largely inactive and inauthentic audience. Furthermore,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/@KiwiAlexJanssen/celebration-box-nz-iyia-liu-and-the-medias-credibility-crisis-exposed-5a594c40f4f8">analytics through SimilarWeb</a>&nbsp;also indicated a low number of visitors to the website.</p>



<p><mark>Signs of trouble began to show publicly when the company hosted a large sale of their clothing collection late last year, with Iyia Liu asking for volunteers that would be paid in clothing instead of a wage.</mark></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0_7waBe1_TJbNnMQtL-1-576x1024.jpeg" alt="Bambi Boutique looking for staff, to pay in clothing." class="wp-image-139" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0_7waBe1_TJbNnMQtL-1-576x1024.jpeg 576w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0_7waBe1_TJbNnMQtL-1-169x300.jpeg 169w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0_7waBe1_TJbNnMQtL-1-768x1365.jpeg 768w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0_7waBe1_TJbNnMQtL-1-864x1536.jpeg 864w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0_7waBe1_TJbNnMQtL-1.jpeg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></figure></div>



<p>From what is stated in Bambi Boutique’s sale announcement, the company made an average weekly turnover of $8,990 over a period of 38 weeks.</p>



<p>Celebration Box itself still boasts strong numbers, claiming that at least 18,000 boxes had been sent out by early March. But how many un-refunded boxes have been sold remains a hotly discussed subject among close followers of Iyia’s business activity.</p>

<p>With Celebration Box itself quoted as having to raise prices in order to stay in operation, it is uncertain if this business is making a profit. Speculators and former employees of the company claim that the number of free boxes sent to Instagram influencers and businesses in exchange for advertising remains a significant part of Celebration Box’s marketing strategy. And while Celebration Box attempted to break into the&nbsp;<a href="https://celebrationbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overseas market</a>&nbsp;in January, its global social media pages&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/celebrationbox_global/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are noticeably inactive</a>.</p>



<p>As far as future plans, Ms Liu stated during a Q&amp;A session in early January about her interest in getting back into fitness. Whether this means a new product or just influencing has yet to be announced. But she also stated in the same Q&amp;A that she did not have a new business in the pipeline.</p>

<p><strong>How the “Insta-Famous” Entrepreneur, Iyia Liu, exploited New Zealand’s media to sell a botched brand disguised as success and inspiration</strong></p>



<h2>First Thoughts</h2>



<p>This has nothing to do with gender or heritage. Women are often expected to talk more often about failures than men. This case is more about Iyia Liu selling a brand and a story that isn’t close to reality, similar to Kim Dotcom, Where we’re often told to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bqq60ylg41N/">choose kindness</a> instead of calling someone out for acting unethically. Journalists built a sensationalised backstory of shoddy guesswork based on a comedy of oversights, which has led to a string of dodgy companies that regularly take advantage of consumers; Threatening customers and other businesses with legal repercussions if they complain publicly, even going as far as to claim to receive death threats when no arrests have been made.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large foobox"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_uAAP2PXmFFVTsv39e6sDvw-1.png" alt="A typical complaint when searching Iyia Liu on Facebook. Containing recommendations for Iyia to refund money for a poorly ran event." class="wp-image-131" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_uAAP2PXmFFVTsv39e6sDvw-1.png 700w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_uAAP2PXmFFVTsv39e6sDvw-1-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption>A typical complaint when searching Iyia Liu on Facebook. (Source: Facebook)</figcaption></figure>



<p>I hope this serves as a cautionary tale, especially to journalists who regularly contribute to the credibility crisis in New Zealand media. It is shocking that so many low tier posers get away with selling their daily list of alternative facts and guesswork without a challenge. I have no place in classifying an idea as stolen or bad, that isn’t what this is about. People take business ideas and ruin smaller firms all the time. But the pattern of missteps by the person in question reveals what many from the North Shore have observed for years.</p>



<p>Something is not right with this business and people should be able to start speaking out without finding themselves defamed or threatened with a lawsuit. I wouldn’t care if people are faking it and hiding their personal flaws. But using media fame to scapegoat business ethics while continuously scheming people is unacceptable, and the journalists that regularly take part in promoting obvious spruikers have no place writing in the era of “fake news”.</p>



<h2>A Silenced Majority</h2>



<p>If you’re a regular social media user in New Zealand, it seems that no one is escaping the drama surrounding Celebration Box NZ. Their confectionary boxes have received well deserved negative attention,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqebhQtAGhl/" target="_blank">including a longish rant by Instagram food reviewer, Albert Cho</a>.</p>

Like who the fuck do you think I am? Do you really think I’d be that fucking clueless to not look past all the store bought chocolate? The doughnuts are literally plain doughnuts that were bulk bought from a cheap as fuck supplier, not even glazed with sugar and then melted chocolate poured on top with old Kit Kat bars broken on to them. Then they’re just placed in a fucking box with a shit load of chocolate bars from the supermarket which were also fucking hard, the least you could do is put a solid effort into your fucking doughnuts. You just can’t fucking call yourself a business and charge up to $100 for a box of these when there are businesses out there like Doe Donuts @doe.donuts who have literally studied for years on how to make the perfect dough, wake up at 4am every Friday and charge almost half the price but don’t even have a quarter amount of your followers.  Celebration Box is a joke and I refuse to take you seriously because it seems like you don’t take yourselves seriously either. The fact that you have that many Instagram followers and people hyping your products is absolutely fucking cooked and it’s businesses like this that give me fucking trust issues. Step your shit up and actually provide your followers and customers with some quality food instead of treating them like a joke. I can name a fuck load more businesses who deserve your followers and popularity so much more than you as they’re fucking willing to put in the effort to genuinely give people their money’s worth and make people happy. The days of clueless wannabe Instagram influencers supporting any fucking random page with the letter “k” in their followers number are coming to an end. 1/10, I’m giving it a 1 just because food never deserves a zero as there are people dying of starvation</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eatlitfood/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> 𝓔𝓪𝓽 𝓛𝓲𝓽 𝓕𝓸𝓸𝓭</a> (@eatlitfood) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2018-11-22T08:12:29+00:00">Nov 22, 2018 at 12:12am PST</time></p></div></blockquote><script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://celebrationbox.co.nz/" target="_blank">Celebration Box</a>, based on the company&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dessertboxes.com.au/" target="_blank">Dessert Boxes</a>&nbsp;in Australia, started in mid-2018. But only after a few weeks, the company had already copped multiple viral social media posts by customers airing out frustrations, not only toward the company but with one of its founders, Iyia Liu. While co-owner, Briar Howard, effectively owns fifty per cent of the company, Liu has remained the sole antagonist behind the brand’s controversy. Poor quality shipments and non-existent customer service are often cited by hundreds of complaints online. This comes after customers reported not being able to reach the company by email or social media. In response to an influx of negative comment complaints, Celebration Box NZ engaged in deleting and blocking commenters while continuing to feature gleaming photos of sponsored influencers posing as “happy customers.” According to the National Business Review (NBR), Iyia Liu admitted to deleting and blocking customers, citing the need to protect the image of her brands; claiming that all of her unsatisfied customers were refunded.</p>

<p>Definitely a few trolls persist in promoting the stories and sh*tposts on both sides of the doughnut debacle, but there are a few worthwhile observations coming out of this drama regardless. It’s a fact that the media wasn’t accurate in their reporting on Celebration Box’s “instafamous” co-owner, Iyia Liu. But despite the commerce commission’s fair trading act investigation and exposed connection to a dubious property scheme, the media’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/108443399/what-instafamous-entreprenuer-iyia-liu-learnt-from-her-celebration-box-debacle" target="_blank">reaction</a>&nbsp;seems to be keeping her company’s reputation afloat, at least from the outside. Honest reviews remain hard to come by. Instead, prominent celebrities like Max Key and a hoard of micro-influencers regularly post praises about her and the atrocious doughnut boxes, as if nothing is stopping her success.</p>

<p>Continually, the company regularly posts memes and jokingly odd giveaways, including a nugget tower and a Macca’s burger box. It looks as if the company is not taking anyone seriously while wondering why people do not like their uncaring approach to running a business. Whenever a mistake is made, customers are reportedly gaslighted and receive constant blame for a comedy of errors that seem to appear more often than not.</p>

<p>Multiple customers and critics of Celebration Box have also reported bullying from Ms Liu’s flatmates and friends, including Iyia herself. These complaints often come from customers who posted publicly on Facebook and Twitter about their negative experiences with Celebration Box and Ms Liu. Since the company cannot delete a negative review on a personal page, employees and diehard fans pled negative reviewers to remove posts and to remain positive, claiming that the company’s owners and employees were targets of death threats and hate mail.</p>



<p>Famously, after failing to deliver on a reported 2,500 orders for Father’s Day weekend, Iyia Liu decided to unapologetically post a photo of herself on a sponsored beach resort holiday in Bali, asking for customers to empathise. Ms Liu’s empathy post also tagged the venue she was staying at on both Facebook and Instagram. Ironically,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/107015904/commerce-commission-dealing-with-complaints-about-celebration-box" target="_blank">Stuff decided to embed her photo directly</a>, inviting more likes (and haters) down the road.</p>

We’ve only had the best intentions, we have tried to right every wrong and are still trying to, give our little team who is still learning some time to fix every problem, because we’re all still learning and all trying to do our best <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iyialiu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> Iyia Liu <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f339.png" alt="🌹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> (@iyialiu) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2018-09-10T21:18:29+00:00">Sep 10, 2018 at 2:18pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>

<p>Her photo-op did not go down well with customers as the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/most-read-complaints-made-commerce-commission-after-celebration-boxs-sweet-startup-gig-turns-sour-online" target="_blank">only apology cited by the company at the time came from co-founder, Briar Howard</a>. Over the next weeks, several text messages had flooded social media among private chats and groups showing how Ms Liu had positioned herself and the company as victims of “rude and irrelevant” bullies, threatening to sue anyone that allegedly defames her and her businesses. Incredibly, instead of significantly improving her products, Iyia Liu has been more focused on trying to prove the haters wrong, showing that her business model is working. After doubts about the company’s sales were expressed, Instagram stories started posting the numbers of boxes being shipped regularly, citing anywhere from 200 to 300 boxes a day; In one case, 1000 boxes supposedly shipped out at once for the Christmas holidays. It seems like all smoke and mirrors to point out daily sales numbers in Instagram stories. If the business is doing well, an audit to the media can easily quash speculation.</p>

<p>By late November, the saga had shown no signs of letting up. A Facebook and Instagram parody page, aptly named, Celebration Bots NZ cropped up and began reposting deleted comments from disgruntled and ignored customers. On the surface, it’s aimed at trolling Iyia Liu, but it has quietly become a hub to help disgruntled customers resolve their order disputes. Because the page’s URL and display name are similar to Celebration Box (spelled with an I instead of an L), it’s able to capture some complaints and questions meant for the actual company. This was done so that instead of complaints going ignored like before, the parody page can send customers directly to commerce commission investigators. The page has no estimate of how many people have filed a complaint because of their existence, but they have stated most incidents now are late deliveries, missing items, and products sitting stale in courier facilities overnight.</p>

<p>The parody page steadily grew in numbers after Instagram suspended the official company’s account, leaving only the parody page searchable. Celebration Bots joyously posted a photo of the Instagram suspension notice and claimed that Celebration Box was flagged for using fake accounts to harass and bullying critics. In response, Celebration Box contended they were trolled by someone filing fraudulent copyright claims against their page,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/commerce-commission-opens-investigation-into-celebration-box-owners-say-death-threats-were-made-against-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this was later confirmed by an Instagram spokesperson to 1 News</a>.</p>



<p>The parody page was taken down for over a week by Facebook due to reports of bullying and harassment, but it was eventually restored.</p>



<p>Ms Liu took to Instagram to claim the parody page was being handled by someone cyberbullying her for the last 2–3 months, buying likes for Celebration Box’s accounts, creating false accounts to impersonate her on social media, and sending false information to the press, including people she works with. I was among the people who received a barrage of details about her starting in late September. I will never condone bullying, but I also do not believe that gathering information about a prominent figure could constitute to cyberbullying, especially if they primarily indulge in dodgy business practices and consistently intimidate others who are speaking out. This person communicated their strict conditions of blocking Iyia Liu personally and never sent any message to her for any information, but only encouraged journalists to contact her about public information and complaints regarding her companies. Despite this rule, Liu had continued “working with the authorities,” including Netsafe, to investigate claims of harassment targeted against her. In response, several cease and desist orders were sent to Iyia Liu by the parody page and suspected trolls, alleging that she was defaming them for criticising her business ethics and how she has been misusing the Harmful Digital Communications Act. The Celebration Bots page persisted in explaining that Netsafe was being used because a frivolous defamation lawsuit would cost Liu at least $30,000, fees she cannot afford according to them. Ms Liu withdrew her Netsafe complaint within 2 weeks of submission without any clarification and unstated reason.</p>



<p>So far, most information the so-called cyberbullies have sent to the media is available in the companies register and is backed up by screenshot copies of comments and emails. Passing on such information, if they’re seemingly volunteered from other people, shouldn’t qualify as sending false information, especially if contact details and relevant sources are invariably included.</p>

<p>The first leaks started with a screen capture of a few complaints here and there, but they quickly ascended into a massive cloud folder containing not only information about Celebration Box but every company Iyia Liu has been involved in. Also provided was a dossier concerning Liu and what is believed to be a set of dubious connections and behaviours that she’s been engaged in, contradictory to the media claims of the last few years. Slowly, these files have been used to publish and retract stories, seemingly on a whim. For Instance, The Herald on Sunday almost featured a top story on Iyia’s “beauty empire,” Girls in Business, only for it to be deleted and retracted entirely.</p>

<p>As the story goes, Iyia’s first online clothing business named I’ll Take all Three (ITAT) launched a month after she graduated from The University of Auckland in 2014. According to Iyia, this first venture failed, and she shut it down in just five months. But her next attempts, Waist Trainer, started in mid-2015 and Luxe Fitness in April 2016 helped launch Iyia’s career. Under the same ITAT Limited company registration, Ms Liu sold modern day corsets and protein products using the online platform, Shopify. Shortly after paying Kylie Jenner a sum of $300,000 to endorse her waist trainers, Iyia Liu became a sensational success story for the media, highlighting her $6,000 investment that became a $3.5 million turnover business. There’s less information about Luxe Fitness’ individual success, but Liu eventually sold both Waist Trainer and Luxe Fitness for an undisclosed amount by early 2017. The financing statement available in the company’s register shows the sale of LUXE was made to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coys.co.nz/:entity?no=373345&amp;nzbn=9429039514127&amp;name=TAKI+TRADING+COMPANY+LIMITED" target="_blank">Taki Trading Limited</a>&nbsp;in Christchurch, which has family ties to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbr.co.nz/gilbert-ullrich" target="_blank">Wine and Tourism Rich Lister, Gilbert Ullrich</a>. The waist trainer products that Iyia Liu became famous for are now being sold under the LUXE brand, suggesting that the two brands were sold in one transaction to the same buyer. The National Business Review&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbr.co.nz/Ilya-Liu-24" target="_blank">erroneously stated that Waist Trainer was sold to West Auckland businesswoman Ruchika Dhingra</a>, who registered an unrelated company with the name&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coys.co.nz/:entity?no=6074397&amp;nzbn=9429042497509&amp;name=DGRA+GROUP+LIMITED" target="_blank">Waist Trainer New Zealand Limited</a>&nbsp;in August 2016.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/auckland/comments/9ina9l/the_great_celebration_box_review_was_it_worth_the/e6l3513/">Some comments on Reddit</a> allege the sale remains incomplete due to the presence of a creditor financing statement in the companies register, showing Ms Liu as a creditor nearly two years after the reported deal was made in January 2017.</p>

<p>What’s wild is the media’s constant coverage of Iyia’s successes. TVNZ did not hold back in showing off Iyia’s 2012 Mercedes Benz G-Class and how she’s living luxuriously with her partner at a Dairy Flat mansion (a rental with flatmates by the way). To several news outlets, she went on to claim further about which supercars she’s driven and the house that she is building in Coatesville,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.iyialiu.com/blog/2018/6/19/my-story" target="_blank">mortgage-free</a>, despite Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) reports stating otherwise. The $3.5 million mortgage instrument was lodged in September 2017 and claimed as an unused line of credit; Coincidently this is the same $3.5 million figure she ostensibly made in turnover with Waist Trainer.&nbsp;In May 2018, the NBR incorrectly&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbr.co.nz/Ilya-Liu-24" target="_blank">cited a $1.56 million rental property in Pinehill as her own residence</a>, (she moved out from this property to a Dairy Flat rental in March) citing it as owned by a trust lawyer, despite the last sale of that home taking place in July 2013, according to QV.co.nz; The latest sale on that home was made while she was still attending The University of Auckland. In the same NBR interview, the financial questions also came down to how her parents taught her how to place her assets in trusts (keep this in mind for later), suggesting that the sale of her previous companies was for millions, or “enough to buy her first home.”</p>



<p>According to the National Business Review’s follow up, these claims seem exaggerated as a way to sell her personal consulting and coaching brand as the founder of “several global, multi-million dollar successful businesses from scratch.” Additionally, Iyia’s Instagram is filled with “glamorous” holidays to Bali or the Greek Islands, but each adventure is cluttered in a barrage of sponsored tags of hotels and swimwear, suggesting that most of these photo-worthy trips are paid for by sponsors. Most suspicious is Iyia’s follower count which only gains followers in 1 to 2-day spikes; it has moved from 3,000 to nearly 70,000 to 46,000 within a year and a half. Her account is still losing over 1000 followers a month which doesn’t seem rational. Maybe this can explain why Celebration Box gained up to 78,000 followers so quickly.&nbsp;<mark>Bambi Boutique gained nearly 158,000 followers within 4 days</mark>&nbsp;but the number of likes per post remained nearly the same, in-fact engagement percentage went down due to the sheer number of followers obtained practically overnight.&nbsp;<mark>For comparison, Max Key’s largest spike of 20k followers took place over a timeframe of one month.</mark>&nbsp;Max’s account has grown until stabilising at around 60k followers. There’s a lack of comparisons for Bambi Boutique’s growth because most similar companies (most show&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/stellyclothing/legacy" target="_blank">steady gradual growth</a>) had obtained a significant following before Instagram allowed sites like socialblade to track followers.</p>

<p>To fans, Iyia’s fictive persona as a successful entrepreneur commands respect and attention. To these women, seeing a boss “building a beauty empire” in her twenties and living the luxe life is truly inspiring. Ms Liu is often invited to star-studded events throughout Auckland, mingling with the likes of Jake Millar and Max Key. It’s hard to find a high-profile event at The Herald’s, Spy News, without Ms Liu in a picture or two. Any person with this status, especially a female, is a primary target for harassment and tall poppy syndrome from her counterparts, but the ethics of her businesses, constant over-exaggeration of wealth, and questionable personal investments have made it more apparent that her dissenters have a lot more substance than the average troll.</p>



<h2 id="483b">Cracks Begin to Show</h2>



<p>Misleading the media and her followers with the luxe lifestyle seems to have worked in the interim. Iyia’s recently started clothing brand, Bambi Boutique, garnered instant press for&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theregister.co.nz/news/2018/02/bambi-boutique" target="_blank">hosting an influencer-studded launch</a>. So instead of taking several months of ad campaigns to build a following, she merely sends a press release, and the media will regurgitate her “Kiwi Millionaire” label with a synopsis of her new business of nonrefundable products. Celebration Box seemed to have blown up in popularity&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12107216" target="_blank">due to this tactic</a>, with nearly 6,000 boxes selling within the first couple of months of operation. But with the quality of her products falling flat, more questions arose about how savvy she actually is as a businesswoman. Scepticism regarding the legitimacy of not only Celebration Box but her previous ventures were now starting to come out. In Iyia’s 50,000 strong Girls in Business group, member comments were reportedly deleted and also blocked for posting critical feedback about her events.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_LhgI6761wb970qkkQn27dA.png" alt="Comment complaint about Iyia Liu's Girls in Business not providing refunds." class="wp-image-124" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_LhgI6761wb970qkkQn27dA.png 456w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_LhgI6761wb970qkkQn27dA-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /><figcaption>Complaints about Girls in Business. (Screenshot/Supplied)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Based on several comment complaints, Girls in Business received significant backlash due to speakers not showing up and amenities not being delivered as promised; Members providing seemingly constructive criticism on how to improve the event were immediately blocked and deleted from the group. Girls in Business’ first annual networking event in November, featuring Karen Walker and Suzy Cato, was supposedly better organised, but copped&nbsp;<a href="https://thespinoff.co.nz/business/15-11-2018/boss-babes-this-way-inside-the-most-instagrammed-business-event-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative criticism from The Spinoff</a>&nbsp;for being too focused on beauty and Instagram influencing, describing the market as substantially saturated.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>It also seems Iyia’s Bambi Boutique brand is even facing some woes of entering the said saturated market. Despite its massive social media presence of about 196,000 followers (with 0.54% engagement), web analytics reveal significantly less activity for this business, ranking it as New Zealand’s 11,394th most visited website in November 2018. To provide a better perspective of this statistic, Celebration Box took over five months to reach 10,000 orders and ranked as New Zealand’s 4,759th most visited website. Celebration Box is clearly a good idea with market demand, but it’s execution certainly leaves the brand scathed for life. Now that she’s focused on selling her personal brand through Girls in Business and IyiaLiu.com, the example of poor business practices behind her should encourage anyone to question how valuable her advice really is.</p>

<p>All influencers are faking it to some extent, that’s what the platform is built on. Two or three decently profitable companies is far from being a failure and should be praised. Deleting comments is illogical unless there’s clear abuse involved. According to a few leaked screenshots, one business owner cited waiting for thousands of dollars in cash and products after waiting for weeks for Iyia Liu to get back to her, within the hour the comment was deleted, and she was blocked. Our supposed proof of this woman getting her money back is hearsay from Celebration Box’s accountant claiming that a refund was made, nothing else. There appears to be a lot more hidden beneath the surface, considering that they’ve lasted for this long with bad press and still seem to garner so many customers and supporters.</p>



<h2 id="c5c8">A Family Connection Exposed</h2>



<p>The dubious connections exposed by the National Business Review are dodgy and sounds like the workings of a Ponzi pyramid scheme that she’s deeply involved in. The exposure was enough to inspire&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/3883432/26823665/entityFilingRequirement" target="_blank">Iyia’s family trust to be removed as a shareholder, as of 18 November, from suspicious investments altogether</a>. According to the Herald, Iyia Liu has referred to learning from her “business-savvy property developer” parents, and that she has never received any financial help from them for her businesses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Iyia_Liu_Caroline_Zhao.png" alt="" class="wp-image-202" width="928" height="598" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Iyia_Liu_Caroline_Zhao.png 928w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Iyia_Liu_Caroline_Zhao-300x193.png 300w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Iyia_Liu_Caroline_Zhao-768x495.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /><figcaption>Caroline Zhao (left) pictured with daughter, Iyia Liu. (Source: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some clues to who Iyia’s parents are in countless articles refer to a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/how-to-start-a-beauty-company/" target="_blank">Beijing born property developers</a>, but never a name. It appears intentional that she wouldn’t name her parents for the record if they are already savvy in the Auckland business scene. It wasn’t until the National Business Review reported on Celebration Box in late October that the connection between Iyia Liu and her mother, alleged property pyramid-schemer, Caroline Zhao, had surfaced.</p>



<p>Caroline Zhao, partnered with Dan McEwan (formerly Robert Ewan), run NZ Commercial Services. Through this company, they provide trustee services, directing investments towards property and retail projects. The lot of property trusts are tied to a property scheme they run called Future Living (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://futureliving.global/" target="_blank">http://futureliving.global</a>). Dan McEwan has been exposed for running elusive schemes before. He was sentenced in 2009 with Securities Act Charges, after leaving investors out-of-pocket for $100 million worth of mortgages. When it came down to paying reparations, he declared bankruptcy, for which he was automatically discharged in 2012.<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10560256" target="_blank"></a></p>

<p>The gist is for investors to pay a large deposit and in return, the company will build a home on subdivided land at nearly 50% of the cost, minimal GST, promising the home to be debt-free within 10-years. Additionally, investors would receive up to 25% rental yield on the property for their own profit. Other promises include enabling investors to qualify for purchasing a car or a boat as part of the package along with a possible additional $500,000 for a mortgage. Despite Future Living projects being started throughout New Zealand, none of these properties has ever been built. Investors are often fleeced for a partially constructed home and if built at all. In the case of Waiwera Heights Country Club, the project was immediately stopped once Auckland Council&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localmatters.co.nz/news/6491-hibiscus-news-archives-2016-july-2016-court-investigates-waiwera-development-plans.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found the build plans to be dangerous and unrealistic</a>. Interestingly, almost all of the construction firms involved in the build became insolvent and were eventually struck off the companies office register.</p>

<p>How Liu is connected to this is not farfetched from the fact that she has continually been a director or shareholder of trusts named, K &amp; C Future Living Trustees, New Zealand Asia Trustees, and similarly titled company registrations. Most of these trusts remained in the care of Ms Liu and her sister until the end of 2015 when they vacated their shareholdings. However, a striking majority of these trusts eventually changed names into Future Living, and with Caroline Zhao and Dan McEwan ultimately taking over as directors. These trusts have grown to form a web of companies and trusts that are related to building or supplying Future Living development projects that Iyia is involved in promoting.</p>

<p><mark>Most importantly, there is a family trust (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coys.co.nz/:entity?no=5836148&amp;nzbn=9429042039143&amp;name=IYIA+FAMILY+TRUSTEES+LIMITED" target="_blank">Iyia Family Trustees Limited</a>) which owns land in Coatesville where Iyia Liu is building a 500m² home to highlight her success in business; It had shareholdings benefiting from one of Future Living’s notorious projects, Waiwera Heights Country Club Limited.</mark>&nbsp;After the connections came out, trust shareholdings changed significantly and became even more obfuscated than before.</p>

<p>Above all, I will leave these to the imagination, but all of these Future Living, One Future, and NZ Department Store schemes are tied to these trusts. The only ones close to these trusts also seem to be members of this family. With no subtlety in hiding who the beneficiaries are as all of these trusts are managed by Caroline Zhao.</p>



<p>As Dan McEwan has become less involved in the business due to his age, Caroline Zhao has effectively taken over. Shortly after the NBR reported, Dan McEwan was removed from company registrations for good, leaving Caroline Zhao as the sole director of NZ Commercial Services and many underlying companies. On Caroline’s Instagram page, her bio advertises all of future living’s sales points promising high rental yield and a 10 years debt-free home. Also, there are featured photos of Iyia’s ventures up to Celebration Box, showing that she’s keen on what her daughter is doing in business and her interactions with the media.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Caroline’s Instagram posts suggest that she is already expanding the Future Living/Global Future brand overseas to the United Kingdom&nbsp;and China. Posts about new offices and partners are frequent in Caroline’s timeline. She has even posted about herself sitting nearly front row to China’s Former chief trade negotiator, Long Yongtu, at a 2016 China Global Investment Forum in Hangzhou. Also in attendance, stated by Ms Zhao, were China’s Ministers of Trade and Foreign Affairs. Unsurprisingly, according to Caroline’s social media, this forum also served as a launch for cross-border/belt road announcements.</p>

<p>There is little information as to what was discussed at the meeting that was dated 21 December 2016. But according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asianinvestor.net/event/4th-china-global-investment-forum/436234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AsianInvestor.net</a>, one of the groups mentioned at the meeting as either sponsors or hosts, China Global Investment Forum, has historically hosted hundreds of “senior investors from China’s government investment funds, insurance companies, trusts, pensions funds, family offices as well as fund selectors and heads of distribution from China’s private banks to discuss global investment opportunities.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_uxRbGI3WGDDDLmrIwpZpkA.png" alt="Iyia Liu's mother, Caroline Zhao pictured with Bill English at the National Party's Conference in 2017." class="wp-image-115" width="1899" height="1299" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_uxRbGI3WGDDDLmrIwpZpkA.png 1899w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_uxRbGI3WGDDDLmrIwpZpkA-300x205.png 300w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_uxRbGI3WGDDDLmrIwpZpkA-1024x700.png 1024w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_uxRbGI3WGDDDLmrIwpZpkA-768x525.png 768w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_uxRbGI3WGDDDLmrIwpZpkA-1536x1051.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1899px) 100vw, 1899px" /><figcaption>Caroline Zhao with then PM, Sir Bill English.

<p>Along with networking at high-level trade events in China, Caroline also seems to have made headway into local politics. Several pictures displayed posing with the likes of Sir John Key and, then Prime Minister, Sir Bill English. The problem is that the National Party has already been caught out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/107915296/alleged-national-donor-yikun-zhang-bringing-1000-wellconnected-compatriots-to-nz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accepting unusually large donations from known affiliates of China’s ruling Communist Party</a>. Cozying to a known schemer with cross-border connections is not a good precedent to set for New Zealand politics.</p>



<h2 id="2dee">Moving Forward</h2>



<p>Iyia’s branding and reputation took a hit in this latest debacle especially since her tendency is to focus more on what fans say, which has backfired. Waist trainer (sold as a hunger suppression tool) was already controversial, but in light of what is now known, the media handed her borrowed time.</p>



<p>She has taken to Instagram many times in an attempt to set the record straight with her fans, albeit through sponsored posts. But it looks like the only ones left buying her story are those also building their own Instagram perfect images. In the end, it all still seems fabricated and inauthentic.&nbsp;It’s a hive mind within the influencer community where beauty and wealth are valued above personal responsibility. With the expensive car and houses, it’s hard to tell how well her companies actually perform since they seem to be performing poorly. Iyia’s saving grace is through her business course students. But how hot they are really doing has yet to be determined by qualified sources (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/groundbreaking-geelong-skincare-business-on-track-to-make-1-million-a-year/news-story/fa82c5f7c4b1d12d50525d1104966e74" target="_blank">news.com.au</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12162536" target="_blank">The Herald</a>&nbsp;just doesn’t cut it). Celebration Box has launched its international site, but the brand seems to be tarnished beyond repair. Shortly after hitting 10,000 orders during the Christmas season, the company allegedly has had to raise prices on a number of products due to not covering a lot of their costs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/celebration_box_cost_comments.png" alt="" class="wp-image-205" width="960" height="830" srcset="https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/celebration_box_cost_comments.png 960w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/celebration_box_cost_comments-300x259.png 300w, https://ipfs.nzfreepress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/celebration_box_cost_comments-768x664.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption>Screenshot supplied</figcaption></figure>



<p>This all begs the question, do all of these businesses serve as a front for the larger scheme at hand? Someone that can supposedly afford to purchase $1.5 million in land and obtain a $3.5 million unused revolving mortgage should be at least $5 million in net worth which doesn’t seem to be the case. Something suggests that there’s a lot more to where this is all coming from because her story still doesn’t add up.</p>

<h4><em>UPDATE 15/2/19</em></h4>



<p>A major clue about how the mortgage was likely obtained is a Caveat instrument lodged by LM Waiwera Investment Limited on 20/9/2017 (same date the $3.5 million mortgage was lodged on Iyia’s property). The lodged document with LINZ highlights “pursuant to an agreement to mortgage contained in the agreement to sale and purchase shares dated 4th October”. This document may refer to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/3892257/23461667/entityFilingRequirement" target="_blank">shares owned by New Zealand Asia Trustees Limited</a>&nbsp;a company which HID Trustees Company Limited&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/3883432/23451530/entityFilingRequirement?backurl=%2Fcompanies%2Fapp%2Fui%2Fpages%2Fcompanies%2F3883432%2Fdocuments%3Fbackurl%3DH4sIAAAAAAAAAC2MQQrDIBREb%252BPGRU4gRYgEwYZSLYHuPvppA40a%252FRZy%252B0robuYxb4YML6yDT1uGuPZUEYp%252FX7YUUFSCGKAERkdGgZFW6hO2i1kt%252FKmkkfPIpdWSu%252FvDOqUsN%252FqqnRoZhC9Ej%252BEGET%252BCSkN2%252BofrV1VIY%252F7dElCrU0ktn%252FgHkog%252BbJEAAAA%253D" target="_blank">allocated shares in on 4 October 2016</a>, with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/3883432/23535557/entityFilingRequirement?backurl=%2Fcompanies%2Fapp%2Fui%2Fpages%2Fcompanies%2F3883432%2Fdocuments%3Fbackurl%3DH4sIAAAAAAAAAC2MQQrDIBREb%252BPGRU4gRYgEwYZSLYHuPvppA40a%252FRZy%252B0robuYxb4YML6yDT1uGuPZUEYp%252FX7YUUFSCGKAERkdGgZFW6hO2i1kt%252FKmkkfPIpdWSu%252FvDOqUsN%252FqqnRoZhC9Ej%252BEGET%252BCSkN2%252BofrV1VIY%252F7dElCrU0ktn%252FgHkog%252BbJEAAAA%253D" target="_blank">Iyia’s Family trust splitting these shares 50/50 on 21 October</a>.</p>



<p>Caveats can be used on an estate or valuable interest to serve as collateral in order to secure a loan or “2nd mortgage”. It prevents any dealings, including the sale or transfer of that property as long as the Caveat is not withdrawn or cancelled. Based on LINZ documents, it looks like the shares of Waiwera Heights Country Club Limited are being used as a caveat towards a mortgage with the shares mentioned being used as collateral.</p>



<p>Prior mortgages on this property include family members and recently immigrated investors. Mortgages also include the owner of the Prince’s Gate Hotel in Rotorua and controversial property developer (and ex-partner of Augustine Lau), Jiawen Mao, based on mortgage instruments with two identities matched to companies office records for investment holdings.</p>
